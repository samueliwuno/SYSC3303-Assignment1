# SYSC3303-Assignment1
Build a very basic three-part system consisting of a client, a proxy, and two servers.The clientâ€™s role is to sequentially send one hundred randomly generated strings of size twenty characters each to some server, which then eliminates the vowels from
the strings and eventually sends them back to the client to print on the screen.

Process

- Run Proxy
- Run Client

Ports used 
 - Server1: 66(receive) and 68(send)
 - Server2: 67(receive) and 69(send)
